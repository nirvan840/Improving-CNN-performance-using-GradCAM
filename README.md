# Improving CNN model performance using GradCAM

We aim to increase model performance in the lack of data and compute scenario. Using XAI for visualizing CNN, we use GradCAMs to visualize these ROIs of the model and develop an iterative process to generate refined datasets to refine the model at each iteration.  

Build as part of the AI hackathon hosted by SARAS-AI (https://www.linkedin.com/company/sarasai/)
